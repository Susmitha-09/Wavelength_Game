-> This Game is a digital version of 'wavelength' board game.
-> There will be two teams playing the game. Player from team 1 has to see the inner markings with score such as 4,3,2 on them. There will be 2 cards with opposite meaning words displayed on screen. The Player has to give a statement in such a way that the other team 1 players has to guess the angle of the inner middle mark i.e., 4 by marking the angle using pointer to score the highest. If they mark exactly on 4 they get score as 4, if they mark on 3 then score will be 3 and so on. Once The team 1 marks the angle between 0-180 degrees using pointer, then Team 2 has to give it's decision saying whether their decision(angle) is towards the left or right of Team 1 pointer.
